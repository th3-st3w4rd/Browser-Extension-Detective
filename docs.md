## Extension Locations

### Chrome

#### Windows

`C:\Users\\<username>\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\`
There is a `Default` location where the main profile is.
If there are multiple profiles, you will see `Profile 1` where the number is incremented on each different profile.
Then under each profile, go into `\extensions\` where there will be more directories with unique ID's as their names.
These unique ID's can be searched on the Google Web Store.
